	3	[Let her create] his [equal], to be one mighty in strength,

	5	They [summoned Aruru], the sister,
	6		[Anu ( . . . )] said to her:
	7	‘[You it was], O Aruru, who created mankind,
			[create now his equal, to be one mighty in strength,]

	1		‘Now, O ∞ama·, Gilgame· . . .

Gilgame· was calling to him.


	1		. . . Enki (or Enkidu?) . . .
	2		 . . . keep consuming
	3		. . . the gods were perturbed.


	1	At the very first light of dawn,
	2		Enkidu lifted up his head, weeping before ∞ama·.
	3	Before the rays of the sun his tears were flowing:
	4		‘I hereby appeal to you, ∞ama·, concerning the hunter, the trapper-man.
	5	As for the “shackler”, who did not let me be a match for [my friend,]
	6		may the hunter not be a match for his friend!
	7	May his income be cut! Diminish his earnings!
	8		May his share (of the profits) be cut in your presence!’
	9	After he had cursed the hunter to his [heart’s] content,
	10		he decided to curse the harlot also.
	11	‘Come, ∞am¿at, I will determine a destiny for you,
	12		I will curse you with a great curse,
	13		my curses shall afflict you swiftly and soon!
	14	May you not found a household to delight in!
	15		may you not sit down in the young women’s chamber!
	16	May the ground defile your fine-looking garment!
	17		May the drunkard smear with dust your festive gown!
	18	May you never acquire a house with utensils and pots,
	19		[ . . . ] . . . of the [potter!]
	20	. . . ∞am¿at, may your . . . man not acquire a pure . . . !
	21		May [ . . . ] the table, the people’s abundance and pride, not be set in your house!
	22	May the bed you delight in be the bench of a [ . . . !]
	23		May the crossroads of the potter be where you sit!
	24	May the ruined houses be where you bed down!
	25		May the lee of the city wall be where you stand!
	26	May briar and thorn skin [your] feet!
	27		May drunk and sober strike [your] cheek!
	28	May [the rabble] of the street congregate in your brothel!
	29		[In your tavern] may there be fights!
	30	[May . . . ] be plaintiff, [may she] claim against [you!]
	31		[May the] builder [not plaster the roof of your house!]
	32	[In your bed-chamber may] there lie [wild] dogs!
	33		[ . . . may no] banquet [take] place!
	36	[ . . . ] . . . [your] present.
	37	[ . . . ] purple [raiment] may . . . !
	38		May a defiled [ . . . ] be the gift of . . . !
	39	[Because] you made me weak, me who was pure!
	40		[And me] who was pure, you made me weak when I was in the wild.’
	41	[∞ama· heard] what he had spoken,
	42		[straight away] a voice cried to him from the heavens:
	43	[‘ . . . . . . ] hunter, trapper-man,
	44		[ . . . . . . ] . . . she/it should be lovely.
	45	[ . . . . . . ] Enkidu, the animals . . . ,
	46		May [ . . . . . . the] prostitute . . . .
	47	You [ . . . ] . . . how will you go up?’
	48	‘Come, ∞am¿at, [I shall determine a destiny for] you,
	49		my mouth that cursed you shall return and bless you:
	50	May governors and noblemen love you,
	51		may he who is one league (distant) slap his thigh!
	52	May he who is two leagues (distant) shake out his locks,
	53		may no soldier be slow to undo his belt for you!
	54	May he give you fingernail and necklace,
	55		may multiple ear-rings deck your ears!
	57	May I·tar, most able of the gods, send you in
	56		to a man whose household is well off, whose storage [bins are heaped] high!
	58	On your account may the first wife be deserted, the mother of seven!’
	59		Gilgame· was sitting before him.
	60	Mulling over what was on his mind,
	61		(Enkidu) spoke to him:
	62	‘All (that I saw), my friend, in the dream of this night:
	63	the heavens thundered and the earth gave echo,
	64		with me standing (there) between them.
	65	There was a man, his expression was grim,
	66		his face was like a ravening Anzû bird.
	67	[His] hands were a lion’s paws,
	68		[his] claws were an eagle’s talons.
	69	He seized me by the hair and overpowered me.’

	[1 The harlot opened her mouth,]
		[saying to] Enkidu:
	‘You are handsome, [Enkidu, you are just like a god,]
		[why do you range] with the beasts of the wild?
	[3 . . ] . . . you are like a god,
		[4 who] among men [is as splendid as you?]’
	[5 The harlot opened her mouth,]
		[saying] to Enkidu:
	‘Come, Enkidu, [6 let me lead you]
		[to the shepherds’ camp,] the site of the sheep-pen.’
	One (garment) she stripped and he dressed himself,
		[7 the other garment she put on herself.]
	[Taking him by the hand, she was walking] before him like a god,
		[to the shepherds’ camp, the site] of the sheep-pen.

	[9 The shepherds gathered about him,]
		[the] crowd [talked] among themselves:
	‘[10 In build he is the equal of Gilgame·,]
		(but) shorter in stature and [11 sturdier] of bone.
	[For sure it is he who was born] in the upland,
		the milk of the beasts [12 he used to suck.]’
	[They put bread before him,]
		peering at the bread, he was perturbed.
	[13 They put beer before him,]
		[he peered at the beer,] he was perturbed.

	[14 The harlot opened her mouth,]
		[saying to Enkidu:]
	‘Eat the bread, Enkidu, [15 fit for a god,]
		[drink the beer,] fit for a king!’
	[16 Enkidu ate the bread until he was sated,]
		[he] drank [the] beer, seven [goblets (full) . . .

	1	He who saw the Deep, the foundation of the country,
	2		who knew the proper ways, was wise in everything!
	3	Gilgame·, who saw the Deep, the foundation of the country,
	4		who knew the proper ways, was wise in everything!
	5	He explored everywhere the seats of power,
	6		he knew the totality of wisdom about all things.
	7	He who travelled the distant road to Uttur-napi·ti,
	8		who crossed the ocean, the wide sea, as far as the sunrise:
	9	he brought back tidings from the antediluvian age.
	10	He went a distant journey and so was weary and in pain;
	11		steles were set up for him (to relate) all (his) labours.
	12	Gilgame· lets no young bride go free to her husband,
	13		he is their (fem.) wild bull, they (fem.) are his cows.
	14	I·tar keeps hearing their complaint,
	15		the terrible din reaching (even) the heaven of Anu.
	16	Surpassing all (other) kings(!), renowned for bodily stature,
	17		hero born in Uruk, butting(?) wild bull!
	18	Gilgame·, renowned for bodily stature,
	19		hero born in Uruk, butting wild bull!
	20	Go up, O Gilgame·, on to the wall of Uruk, 21 walk around,
			survey the foundation platform, inspect the brickwork!
	22	Open the box of cedar wood,
	23		release its clasps of bronze!
	24		Pick up the tablet of lapis lazuli and read out,
	25	thus: “Is not its brickwork kiln-fired brick,
	26		did the seven sages not lay its foundations?
	27	One ·®r is city, one ·®r date-grove, one ·®r is clay pit, half a ·®r the temple of I·tar:
	28		three ·®r and a half (is) Uruk, (its) measurement(?).”
	29	Gilgame· grappled in turn with fifty companions,
			daily holding sway over the young men(!),
	30	he kept wrongfully(!) putting the young men of Uruk in fear.
	31		The strands of his hair were growing thickly as Nissaba’s,
	32	his teeth gleaming like the rising sun,
	33		he had hair (that was dark) like lapis-coloured wool.
	34	Eleven cubits was his height,
	35		four cubits the width of his chest (lit. between his breasts).
