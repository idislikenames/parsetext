Lisa is happy and tired. CP saves the day. The sky is almost blue everyday. I sit in busy traffic for hours.
Because the future is here and we can't go back.
Sue is running fast around a blue lake without feeling tired but somehow she is a bit sad.
I am happy when playing basketball although tired sometimes.
