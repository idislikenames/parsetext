		At the very first light of dawn,
			Enkidu lifted up his head, weeping before ∞ama.
		Before the rays of the sun his tears were flowing:
			‘I hereby appeal to you, ∞ama, concerning the hunter, the trapper-man.
		As for the “shackler”, who did not let me be a match for 
			may the hunter not be a match for his friend!
		May his income be cut! Diminish his earnings!
			May his share  be cut in your presence!’
		After he had cursed the hunter to his  content,
			he decided to curse the harlot also.
		‘Come, ∞am¿at, I will determine a destiny for you,
			I will curse you with a great curse,
			my curses shall afflict you swiftly and soon!
		May you not found a household to delight in!
			may you not sit down in the young women’s chamber!
		May the ground defile your fine-looking garment!
			May the drunkard smear with dust your festive gown!
		May you never acquire a house with utensils and pots,
			 . . . of the 
		. . . ∞am¿at, may your . . . man not acquire a pure . . . !
			May  the table, the people’s abundance and pride, not be set in your house!
		May the bed you delight in be the bench of a 
			May the crossroads of the potter be where you sit!
		May the ruined houses be where you bed down!
			May the lee of the city wall be where you stand!
		May briar and thorn skin  feet!
			May drunk and sober strike  cheek!
		May  of the street congregate in your brothel!
			 may there be fights!

		 purple  may . . . !
			May a defiled  be the gift of . . . !

			 who was pure, you made me weak when I was in the wild.’
		 what he had spoken,
			 a voice cried to him from the heavens:
		 hunter, trapper-man,
			 . . . she/it should be lovely.
		 Enkidu, the animals . . . ,
			May  prostitute . . . .
		You  . . . how will you go up?’
		‘Come, ∞am¿at,  you,
			my mouth that cursed you shall return and bless you:
		May governors and noblemen love you,
			may he who is one league  slap his thigh!
		May he who is two leagues  shake out his locks,
			may no soldier be slow to undo his belt for you!
		May he give you fingernail and necklace,
			may multiple ear-rings deck your ears!
		May Itar, most able of the gods, send you in
			to a man whose household is well off, whose storage  high!
		On your account may the first wife be deserted, the mother of seven!’
			Gilgame was sitting before him.
		Mulling over what was on his mind,
			 spoke to him:
		‘All , my friend, in the dream of this night:
		the heavens thundered and the earth gave echo,
			with me standing  between them.
		There was a man, his expression was grim,
			his face was like a ravening Anzû bird.
		 hands were a lion’s paws,
			 claws were an eagle’s talons.
		He seized me by the hair and overpowered me.’

	
		 Enkidu:
	‘You are handsome, 
		 with the beasts of the wild?
	 . . . you are like a god,
		 among men ’
	
		 to Enkidu:
	‘Come, Enkidu, 
		 the site of the sheep-pen.’
	One  she stripped and he dressed himself,
		
	 before him like a god,
		 of the sheep-pen.

	‘

	 in the upland,

		He who saw the Deep, the foundation of the country,

		Gilgame, who saw the Deep, the foundation of the country,
			who knew the proper ways, was wise in everything!
		He explored everywhere the seats of power,
			he knew the totality of wisdom about all things.
		He who travelled the distant road to Uttur-napiti,
			who crossed the ocean, the wide sea, as far as the sunrise:
		he brought back tidings from the antediluvian age.
		He went a distant journey and so was weary and in pain;
			steles were set up for him  all  labours.
		Gilgame lets no young bride go free to her husband,
			he is their  wild bull, they  are his cows.
		Itar keeps hearing their complaint,
			the terrible din reaching  the heaven of Anu.
		Surpassing all  kings, renowned for bodily stature,
			hero born in Uruk, butting wild bull!
		Gilgame, renowned for bodily stature,
			hero born in Uruk, butting wild bull!
		Go up, O Gilgame, on to the wall of Uruk,  walk around,
			survey the foundation platform, inspect the brickwork!
		Open the box of cedar wood,
			release its clasps of bronze!
			Pick up the tablet of lapis lazuli and read out,
		thus: “Is not its brickwork kiln-fired brick,
			did the seven sages not lay its foundations?
		One ®r is city, one ®r date-grove, one ®r is clay pit, half a ®r the temple of Itar:
			three ®r and a half  Uruk,  measurement.”
		Gilgame grappled in turn with fifty companions,
			daily holding sway over the young men,
		he kept wrongfully putting the young men of Uruk in fear.
			The strands of his hair were growing thickly as Nissaba’s,
		his teeth gleaming like the rising sun,
			he had hair  like lapis-coloured wool.
		Eleven cubits was his height,
			four cubits the width of his chest .
		A triple cubit was his foot and a reed-length his legs,
			a triple cubit the whiskers of his cheeks.
		To . . . of his face.
