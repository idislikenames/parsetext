The Ur tablet (MB Ur)



Translation

	At the very first light of dawn,

	Enkidu lifted up his head, weeping before ama

	Before the rays of the sun his tears were flowing:

	‘I hereby appeal to you, ama, concerning the hunter, the trapper-man.

	As for the “shackler”, who did not let me be a match for [my friend,]

	may the hunter not be a match for his friend!

	May his income be cut! Diminish his earnings!

	May his share (of the profits) be cut in your presence!’

	After he had cursed the hunter to his [heart’s] content,

	he decided to curse the harlot also.

	‘Come, ∞am¿at, I will determine a destiny for you,

	I will curse you with a great curse,

	my curses shall afflict you swiftly and soon!

	May you not found a household to delight in!

	may you not sit down in the young women’s chamber!

	May the ground defile your fine-looking garment!

	May the drunkard smear with dust your festive gown!

	May you never acquire a house with utensils and pots,

	[ . . . ] . . . of the [potter!]

	. . . amat, may your . . . man not acquire a pure . . . !

	May [ . . . ] the table, the people’s abundance and pride, not be set in your house!

	May the bed you delight in be the bench of a [ . . . !]

	May the crossroads of the potter be where you sit!

	May the ruined houses be where you bed down!

	May the lee of the city wall be where you stand!

	May briar and thorn skin [your] feet!

	May drunk and sober strike [your] cheek!

	May [the rabble] of the street congregate in your brothel!

	[In your tavern] may there be fights!

	[May . . . ] be plaintiff, [may she] claim against [you!]

	[May the] builder [not plaster the roof of your house!]

	[In your bed-chamber may] there lie [wild] dogs!

	[ . . . may no] banquet [take] place!

	[ . . . ] . . . [your] present.

	[ . . . ] purple [raiment] may . . . !

	May a defiled [ . . . ] be the gift of . . . !

	[Because] you made me weak, me who was pure!

	[And me] who was pure, you made me weak when I was in the wild.’

	[∞ama· heard] what he had spoken,

	[straight away] a voice cried to him from the heavens:

	[‘ . . . . . . ] hunter, trapper-man,

	[ . . . . . . ] . . . she/it should be lovely.

	[ . . . . . . ] Enkidu, the animals . . . ,

	May [ . . . . . . the] prostitute . . . .

	You [ . . . ] . . . how will you go up?’

	‘Come, ∞am¿at, [I shall determine a destiny for] you,

	my mouth that cursed you shall return and bless you:

	May governors and noblemen love you,

	may he who is one league (distant) slap his thigh!

	May he who is two leagues (distant) shake out his locks,

	may no soldier be slow to undo his belt for you!

	May he give you fingernail and necklace,

	may multiple ear-rings deck your ears!

	May I·tar, most able of the gods, send you in

	to a man whose household is well off, whose storage [bins are heaped] high!

	On your account may the first wife be deserted, the mother of seven!’

	Gilgame· was sitting before him.

	Mulling over what was on his mind,

	(Enkidu) spoke to him:

	‘All (that I saw), my friend, in the dream of this night:

	the heavens thundered and the earth gave echo,

	with me standing (there) between them.

	There was a man, his expression was grim,

	his face was like a ravening Anzû bird.

	[His] hands were a lion’s paws,

	[his] claws were an eagle’s talons.

	He seized me by the hair and overpowered me.’
