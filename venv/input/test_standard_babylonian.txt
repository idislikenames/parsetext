Enkidu replies:
			“My  is one who is experienced in combat,

			You have been smeared in  so you need not fear death.

	All his body is matted with hair,
		he is adorned with tresses like a woman:
	the locks of his hair grow as thickly as Nissaba’s,
		he knows not at all a people nor even a country.
	He was clad in a garment like Šakkan’s,
		feeding on grass with the very gazelles.
	Jostling at the water-hole with the herd,
		he enjoyed the water with the animals.
	A hunter, a trapper-man,
		came face to face with him by the water-hole.
	One day, a second and a third, he came face to face with him by the water-hole.
	The hunter saw him and his expression froze,
		 and his herds — he went back to his lair.
	 troubled, he grew still, he grew silent,
		his mood  his face clouded over.
	There  sorrow in his heart,
		his face was like  distant 

	The hunter opened  to speak, saying 
		‘My father,  certain fellow who came 
	Mightiest in the  strength,
		 is as mighty  from the sky.
	 over the hills 
		 with the herd 
	 his feet  by the water-hole,
		 I do not go up to him.

		 like a mighty man!

	 her and will go up  her,
		his herd will be estranged from him,  in its presence.’
	To the advice of his father  . . .
		the hunter went off 
	He took the road, he  toward Uruk,
		 the king, Gilgameš, 
	‘There was a certain fellow who 
		mightiest in the land, 
		 as mighty as a lump of rock from the sky.
	He wanders over the hills 
		constantly with the herd 
	Constantly his feet  by the water-
		I am afraid and so I do not go up to 
	He has filled in the pits that I dug,
		he has uprooted my snares 
	He has released from my grasp the herds, the animals  wild,
		he will not let me do the work  wild.’
	Gilgameš said to him, to the hunter:
		‘Go, O hunter, take with you Šamḫat the harlot.
	When the herd comes down to the water-hole,
		she should strip off her clothing to reveal her charms.
	He will see her and will go up to her,
		his herd will be estranged from him, though he grew up in its presence.’
	Off went the hunter, he took with him Šamḫat the harlot,
		they set out on the road, they started the journey.
	On the third day they arrived at the destination;
		the hunter and the harlot sat down to wait.
	One day, a second day, they sat by the water-hole,
		 the herd arrived to drink at the water-hole.
	The animals arrived, they enjoyed the water,
		and also Enkidu himself, whose birth-place was the hills.
	Feeding on grass with the very gazelles,
		jostling at the water-hole with the herd,

		he enjoyed the water with the animals.
	 Šamḫat saw him, the man-savage,
		a murderous fellow from the midst of the wild.
	‘This is he, Šamḫat! Uncradle your bosom;
		bare your sex so he may take in your charms!
	Do not show fear, take in his scent!
		He will see you and he will come up to you.
	Spread your clothing so he may lie on you,
		treat the man to the work of a woman!
	His ‘love’ will caress and embrace you,
		his herd will be estranged from him, though he grew up in its presence.’
	Šamḫat let loose her skirts,
 		she bared her sex and he took in her charms.
	She showed no fear, she took in his scent:
		she spread her clothing and he lay upon her.
	She treated the man to the work of a woman,
		his ‘love’ caressed and embraced her.
	For six days and seven nights Enkidu, erect, did couple with Šamḫat.
	After he was sated with her delights,
		he turned his face toward his herd.
	The gazelles saw Enkidu and they started running,
		the animals of the wild moved away from his person.
	Enkidu had defiled his body so pure,
		his legs stood still, though his herd was on the move.
	Enkidu was diminished, his running was not as before,
		but he had reason, he  wide of understanding.
	He came back and sat down at the feet of the harlot,
		watching the harlot,  her features.
	Then his ears heard what the  was speaking,
		 said to him, to Enkidu:
	‘You are handsome, Enkidu, you are just like a god,

		why do you roam the wild with the animals?
	Come, I will lead you to Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
		to the sacred temple, the dwelling of Anu and Ištar!
	where Gilgameš is perfect in strength,
		and lords it over the menfolk like a wild bull.’
	She talked to him and what she said found favour,
		his heart  wise was seeking a friend.
	Enkidu said to her, to the harlot:
	‘Come, Šamḫat, take me along
		to the sacred temple, the holy dwelling of Anu and Ištar,
	where Gilgameš is perfect in strength,
		and lords it over the menfolk like a wild bull!
	I, myself, will challenge him, mighty . . . ,
		 myself in Uruk,  “I am the mightiest!”
	 . . . I shall change the order of things,
		 born in the wild is mighty, he has strength.’
	‘Let  see your face,
		 exists I know indeed.
	Go, Enkidu, to Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
		where the young men are girt with waistbands.
	Every day  a festival is held,
		where the drums are repeatedly beaten,
	and the harlots are comely of figure,
		graced with charm, full of joy.
	The nobles are driven from their beds at night!
		O Enkidu, ] know life—
	I will show you Gilgameš, the man so merry,
		look at him, regard his face!
	He is fair in manhood, he has dignified bearing,
		his whole person is graced with charm.
	He has a strength more mighty than you,
		he is unsleeping by day and by night.
	O Enkidu, get rid of your sinful intention,
		as for Gilgameš Šamaš loves him.
	Anu, Enlil and Ea broadened his wisdom:
		even before you came from the uplands,
	Gilgameš in Uruk was having dreams about you: —
	Gilgameš arose to reveal a dream, saying to his mother:
		“O mother, the dream that I saw in the course of this night —
	the stars of the heavens appeared before me,
		like lumps of rock from the sky they kept falling towards me.
	I picked one up but it was too much for me,
		I kept trying to roll it but I could not dislodge it.
	The land of Uruk was standing around 
		 about it.
	A crowd  before 
		 thronging around it.
	They were kissing its feet  baby’s;
		 like a wife and I caressed and embraced it.

		she knew everything, she said to her son;
	 Ninsun was clever, she was wise,
		she knew everything, she said to Gilgameš:
	“The stars of heaven  before you,

	You picked it up but it was too much for you,
		you kept trying to roll it but you could not dislodge it.
	You picked it up and set it down at my feet,
		and I, I made it your equal,
	you loved it like a wife, caressing and embracing it.
		A mighty companion will come to you, the saviour of  friend:

		his strength is as mighty as a lump of rock from the sky.
	You will love him like a wife, caressing and embracing him,
		he, being mighty,  often save you.

	a	He saw a second dream,
		he arose and entered before the goddess, his mother.
	Gilgameš said to her, to his mother,
		“And again, O mother, I have seen a second dream.
	 of Uruk-Main-Street,
		an axe was lying and people were gathered around it.
	The land  was standing around it,

	The mother of Gilgameš was clever, she was wise,
		she knew everything, she said to her son;
	Wild-Cow Ninsun was clever, she was wise,
		she knew everything, she said to Gilgameš:
	“My son, the axe you saw is a man,
