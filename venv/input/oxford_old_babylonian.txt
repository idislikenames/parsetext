-. Envoys of Aga, the son of En-me-barage-si, came from Kiš to Gilgameš in Unug. Gilgameš presented the issue before the elders of his city, carefully choosing his words: "There are wells to be finished, many wells of the Land yet to be finished; there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. We should not submit to the house of Kiš! {Should we not smite it with weapons?} {( mss. have instead:) Let us smite it with weapons!}"















-. In the convened assembly, his city's elders answered Gilgameš: "There are indeed wells to be finished, many wells of the Land yet to be finished; there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. {So we should submit to the house of Kiš. We should not smite it with weapons!} {( ms. has instead:) So should we not submit to the house of Kiš? Should we smite it with weapons?}"















-. Gilgameš, the lord of Kulaba, placing his trust in Inana, did not take seriously the advice of his city's elders. Gilgameš {( ms. adds:) , the lord of Kulaba,} presented the issue again, this time before the able-bodied men of his city, carefully choosing his words: "There are wells to be finished, many wells of the Land yet to be finished; there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. {Never before have you submitted to the house of Kiš. Should you not smite it with weapons?} {( ms. has instead:) We should not submit to the house of Kiš. We should smite it with weapons!}"















-. In the convened assembly, his city's able-bodied men answered Gilgameš: " "Standing on duty and sitting in attendance, escorting the king's son, and forever grasping the donkey's reins -- who has that much breath?", as the saying goes. You old men should not submit to the house of Kiš! Should we young men not smite it with weapons?"















-. "The great gods created the structure of Unug, the handiwork of the gods, and of E-ana, the house lowered down from heaven. You watch over {the great rampart, the rampart which An founded} {( ms. has instead:) its great rampart, a cloudbank resting on the earth}, the majestic residence which An established. You are its king and warrior, an exuberant person, a prince beloved of An. When Aga comes, what terror he will experience! That army is small, and scattered at the rear. Its men will be incapable of confronting us."















-. Then Gilgameš, the lord of Kulaba, rejoiced at the advice of his city's able-bodied men and his spirit brightened. He addressed his servant Enkidu: "On this account let the weaponry and arms of battle be made ready. Let the battle mace return to your side. May they create a great terror and radiance. When he comes, my great fearsomeness will overwhelm him. His reasoning will become confused and his judgment disarrayed."















-. Not five, not  days had passed when Aga, the son of En-me-barage-si, laid siege to Unug with his men. Unug's reasoning became confused. Gilgameš, the lord of Kulaba, addressed its warriors: " {My warriors shall have the choice.} {( mss. have instead:) My warriors, choose!} Let someone with courage volunteer {"I shall go to Aga"} {( ms. has instead:) , and I will send him to Aga}."















-. Bir?ar-tura, his royal guard, spoke in admiration to his king: " {( mss. add:) My king,} I shall {go} {( ms. has instead:) go prancing (?)} to Aga so that his reasoning will become confused and his judgment disarrayed."















-. Bir?ar-tura went out through the city gate. As soon as Bir?ar-tura went out through the city gate, they captured him at the gate's entrance, and then beat Bir?ar-tura's entire length. He came into the presence of Aga and then spoke to Aga. Before he had finished speaking, an officer of Unug climbed up on the rampart and leaned out over the rampart. Aga saw him and then spoke to Bir?ar-tura: "Slave, is that man your king?"















-. "That man is not my king! Were that man my king, were that his angry brow, were those his bison eyes, were that his lapis lazuli beard, were those his elegant fingers, would he not cast down multitudes, would he not raise up multitudes, would multitudes not be smeared with dust, would not all the nations be overwhelmed, would not the land's canal-mouths be filled with silt, would not the barges' prows be broken, and would he not take Aga, the king of Kiš, captive in the midst of his army?"















-. They hit him, they struck him. They beat Bir?ar-tura's entire length. Gilgameš climbed up on the rampart after the officer of Unug. His radiance overwhelmed Kulaba's young and old. He armed Unug's able-bodied men with battle maces and stationed them on the causeway at the city gate's door. Only Enkidu went out through the city gate. Gilgameš leaned out over the rampart. Looking up, Aga saw him: "Slave, is that man your king?"















-. "That man is indeed my king." It was just as he had said: Gilgameš cast down multitudes, he raised up multitudes, multitudes were smeared with dust, all the nations were overwhelmed, the land's canal-mouths were filled with silt, the barges' prows were broken, and he took Aga, the king of Kiš, captive in the midst of his army. {( ms. adds  line:) Unug's able-bodied men …… that army.}















-. Gilgameš, the lord of Kulaba, {spoke to} {( ms. has instead:) approached close to} Aga: "Aga my overseer, Aga my lieutenant, {( ms. adds  line:) Aga my governor, Aga my commander,} Aga my military commander! Aga gave me breath, Aga gave me life: Aga took a fugitive into his embrace, Aga provided the fleeing bird with grain."















-. {(The able-bodied men acclaim Gilgameš:) "You watch over Unug, the handiwork of the gods, the great rampart, the rampart which An founded, the majestic residence which An established. You are its king and warrior, an exuberant person, a prince beloved of An." (Gilgameš addresses Aga:) "Before Utu, your former kindness is hereby repaid to you."} {(the other ms. has instead:) "I watch over Unug, the handiwork of the gods, its great rampart, a cloudbank resting on the earth, its majestic residence which An established. The city will repay the kindness shown to me. Before Utu, your former kindness is hereby repaid to you."} He set Aga free to go to Kiš.















-. O Gilgameš, lord of Kulaba, praising you is sweet.

-. Great An replied to holy Inana: "My child, the Bull of Heaven would not have any pasture, as its pasture is on the horizon. Maiden Inana, the Bull of Heaven can only graze where the sun rises. So I cannot give the Bull of Heaven to you!"

At Unug, the Bull devoured the pasture, and drank the water of the river in great slurps. With each slurp it used up one mile of the river, but its thirst was not satisfied. It devoured the pasture and stripped the land bare. It broke up the palm trees of Unug, as it bent them to fit them into its mouth.

Gilgameš, Enkidu and the nether world







Version A







-. In those days, in those distant days, in those nights, in those remote nights, in those years, in those distant years; in days of yore, when the necessary things had been brought into manifest existence, in days of yore, when the necessary things had been for the first time properly cared for, when bread had been tasted for the first time in the shrines of the Land, when the ovens of the Land had been made to work, when the heavens had been separated from the earth, when the earth had been delimited from the heavens, when the fame of mankind had been established, when An had taken the heavens for himself, when Enlil had taken the earth for himself, when the nether world had been given to Ereškigala as a gift; when he set sail, when he set sail, when the father set sail for the nether world, when Enki set sail for the nether world -- against the king a storm of small hailstones arose, against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose. The small ones were light hammers, the large ones were like stones from catapults (?). The keel of Enki's little boat was trembling as if it were being butted by turtles, the waves at the bow of the boat rose to devour the king like wolves and the waves at the stern of the boat were attacking Enki like a lion.















-. At that time, there was a single tree, a single ?alub tree, a single tree, growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates, being watered by the Euphrates. The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches, and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away. A woman, respectful of An's words, was walking along; a woman, respectful of Enlil's words, was walking along, and took the tree and brought it into Unug, into Inana's luxuriant garden.















-. The woman planted the tree with her feet, but not with her hands. The woman watered it using her feet but not her hands. She said: "When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat?" She said: "When this will be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down?" Five years,  years went by, the tree grew massive; its bark, however, did not split. At its roots, a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest. In its branches, the Anzud bird settled its young. In its trunk, the phantom maid built herself a dwelling, the maid who laughs with a joyful heart. But holy Inana cried!















-. When dawn was breaking, when the horizon became bright, when the little birds, at the break of dawn, began to clamour, when Utu had left his bedchamber, his sister holy Inana said to the young warrior Utu: "My brother, in those days when destiny was determined, when abundance overflowed in the Land, when An had taken the heavens for himself, when Enlil had taken the earth for himself, when the nether world had been given to Ereškigala as a gift; when he set sail, when he set sail, when the father set sail for the nether world, when Enki set sail for the nether world -- against the lord a storm of small hailstones arose, against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose. The small ones were light hammers, the large ones were like stones from catapults (?). The keel of Enki's little boat was trembling as if it were being butted by turtles, the waves at the bow of the boat rose to devour the lord like wolves and the waves at the stern of the boat were attacking Enki like a lion."















-. "At that time, there was a single tree, a single ?alub tree, a single tree (?), growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates, being watered by the Euphrates. The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches, and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away. I, a woman, respectful of An's words, was walking along; I, a woman, respectful of Enlil's words, was walking along, and took the tree and brought it into Unug, into holy Inana's luxuriant garden."















-. "I, the woman, planted the tree with my feet, but not with my hands. I, {Inana} {( ms. has instead:) the woman}, watered it using my feet but not my hands. She said: "When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat?" She said: "When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down?" Five years,  years had gone by, the tree had grown massive; its bark, however, did not split. At its roots, a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest. In its branches, the Anzud bird settled its young. In its trunk, the phantom maid built herself a dwelling, the maid who laughs with a joyful heart. But holy Inana cried!" Her brother, the young warrior Utu, however, did not stand by her in the matter.















-. When dawn was breaking, when the horizon became bright, when the little birds, at the break of dawn, began to clamour, when Utu had left his bedchamber, his sister holy Inana said to the warrior Gilgameš: "My brother, in those days when destiny was determined, when abundance overflowed in the Land, when An had taken the heavens for himself, when Enlil had taken the earth for himself, when the nether world had been given to Ereškigala as a gift; when he set sail, when he set sail, when the father set sail for the nether world, when Enki set sail for the nether world -- against the lord a storm of small hailstones arose, against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose.

She said: "When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down?" Five years,  years had gone by, the tree had grown massive; its bark, however, did not split. At its roots, a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest. In its branches, the Anzud bird settled its young. In its trunk, the phantom maid built herself a dwelling, the maid who laughs with a joyful heart. But {holy Inana} {( ms. has instead:) I, holy Inana,} cried!" In the matter which his sister had told him about, her brother, the warrior Gilgameš, stood by her.















-. He {strapped} {( ms. has instead:) ……} his …… belt of  minas weight to his waist --  minas were to him as  shekels. He took his bronze axe used for expeditions, which weighs seven talents and seven minas, in his hand. He killed the snake immune to incantations living at its roots. The Anzud bird living in its branches took up its young and went into the mountains. The phantom maid living in its trunk left (?) her dwelling and sought refuge in the wilderness. As for the tree, he uprooted it and stripped its branches, and the sons of his city, who went with him, cut up its branches and {bundled them} {( ms. has instead:) piled them up}. He gave it to his sister holy Inana for her chair. He gave it to her for her bed. As for himself, from its roots, he manufactured his ball (?) and, from its branches, he manufactured his mallet (?).















-. He played with the ball (?) in the broad square, never wanting to stop playing it, and he praised himself in the broad square, never wanting to stop praising himself. {(mss. from Urim add:) The young men of his city were playing with the ball (?).} For (?) him who made the team of the widows' children ……, they lamented: "O my neck! O my hips!" For those that had a mother, the mother brought bread for her son; for those that had a sister, the sister poured water for her brother. As the evening came, he marked the spot where the ball (?) had been placed, and he picked up his ball (?) from in front of him and took it home. But early in the morning as he …… the place marked, the widows' accusation and the young girls' complaint caused his ball (?) and his mallet (?) to fall down to the bottom of the nether world. {( ms. adds:) He could not reach them by …….} He tried with his hand but could not {reach} {( ms. has instead:) touch} them, tried with his foot but could not {reach} {( ms. has instead:) touch} them.















-. At the gate of Ganzer, in front of the nether world, he sat down. Gilgameš wept, crying bitterly: "O my ball (?)! O my mallet (?)! O my ball (?), I am still not satiated with its charms, the game with it has not yet palled for me! If only my ball (?) waited still in the carpenter's house for me! I would treat the carpenter's wife like my own mother -- if only it waited still there for me! I would treat the carpenter's child like my little sister -- if only it waited still there for me! {My ball (?) has fallen down to the nether world -- who will retrieve it for me?} {( ms. has instead:) Who will retrieve my ball (?) from the nether world?} {My mallet (?) has fallen down to Ganzer -- who will retrieve it for me?} {( ms. has instead:) Who will retrieve my mallet (?) from Ganzer?}"















-. His servant Enkidu {answered} {( ms. has instead:) said to} {him} {( ms. has instead:) Gilgameš}: "My king, you weep; why does your heart worry? Today I shall retrieve your ball (?) from the nether world, I shall retrieve your mallet (?) from Ganzer." Gilgameš answered Enkidu: " {If today} {( ms. has instead:) If} you are going to go down to the nether world, let me advise you! My instructions should be followed. Let me talk to you! {Pay attention to my words} {( ms. has instead:) My words should be followed}!"















-. "You should not put on your clean garments: they would recognise immediately that you are alien. You should not anoint yourself with fine oil from a bowl: they would surround you at {its} {( ms. has instead:) your} scent. You should not hurl throw-sticks in the nether world: those struck down by the throw-sticks would surround you. You should not not hold a cornel-wood stick in your hand: the spirits would feel insulted by you. You should not put sandals on your feet. You should not shout in the nether world. You should not kiss your beloved wife. You should not hit your wife even if you are annoyed with her. You should not kiss your beloved child. You should not hit your son even if you are annoyed with him. The outcry aroused would detain you in the nether world."















-. "She who lies there, she who lies there, Ninazu's mother who lies there -- her pure shoulders are not covered with a garment, and no linen is spread over her pure breast. She has fingers like a pickaxe, she plucks her hair out like leeks."















-. Enkidu, however, did not heed not his master's words. He put on his clean garments and they recognised that he was alien. He anointed himself with fine oil from a bowl and they surrounded him at its scent. He hurled throw-sticks in the nether world and those struck down by the throw-sticks surrounded him. He held a cornel-wood stick in his hand and the spirits felt insulted by him. He put sandals on his feet. He caused irritation in the nether world. He kissed his beloved wife and hit his wife when he was annoyed with her. He kissed his beloved child and hit his son when he was annoyed with him. He aroused an outcry and was detained in the nether world.















-. The warrior Gilgameš, son of Ninsumun, directed his steps on his own to E-kur, the temple of Enlil. He cried before Enlil: "Father Enlil, my ball (?) fell down into the nether world, my mallet (?) fell down into Ganzer. Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him. Namtar did not seize him, the Asag did not seize him; but the nether world has seized him. The udug demon of Nergal, who spares nobody, did not seize him, but the nether world has seized him. He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood, but the nether world has seized him." Father Enlil did not stand by him in the matter, so he went to Eridug.















-. In Eridug he directed his steps on his own to the temple of Enki. He cried before Enki: "Father Enki, my ball (?) fell down into the nether world, my mallet (?) fell down into Ganzer. Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him. Namtar did not seize him, the Asag did not seize him; but the nether world has seized him. The udug demon of Nergal, who spares nobody, did not seize him, but the nether world has seized him. He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood, but the nether world has seized him." Father Enki stood by him in this matter.















-. He said to the young warrior Utu, the son born by Ningal: "Open a hole in the nether world immediately, and then bring up his servant from the nether world!" He opened a hole in the nether world and brought up his servant with his breeze (?) from the nether world.















-. They hugged and kissed. They wearied each other with questions: "Did you see the order of the nether world? -- If only you would tell me, my friend, if only you would tell me!" "If I tell you the order of the nether world, sit down and weep! I shall sit down and weep! ……, which your heart rejoiced to touch, is ……, worms infest it like an old garment (?); like …… of (?) a crevice, it is full of dust." "Alas!" he said and sat down in the dust.

"You finish a reed mat, and she weeps over the reed mat." "Did you see him who had no heir?" "I saw him." "How does he fare?" "Like him who …… bricks (?), he eats bread." "……?" "I saw him." "How does he fare?"

Gilgameš and ?uwawa (Version A)







-. Now the lord once decided to set off for the mountain where the man lives; Lord Gilgameš decided to set off for the mountain where the man lives. He spoke to his slave Enkidu:















-. "Enkidu, since a man cannot pass beyond the final end of life, I want to set off into the mountains, to establish my renown there. Where renown can be established there, I will establish my renown; and where no renown can be established there, I shall establish the renown of the gods."















-. His slave Enkidu answered him: "My lord, if today you are going to set off into the mountains, Utu should know about it from us. {( ms. adds:) If you are going to to set off into the Mountains of Cedar-felling, Utu should know about it from us.} Utu, youthful Utu, should know about it from us. A decision that concerns the mountains is Utu's business. A decision that concerns the Mountains of Cedar-felling is the business of youthful Utu. Utu should know about it from us."















-. Gilgameš {prepared} {( mss. have instead:) took hold of} a white kid. {He clasped a brown kid, a sacrificial animal, close to his breast.} {( ms. has instead:) He …… a brown kid.} In his hand he held a holy staff before his nose, as he addressed Utu of heaven:















-. "Utu, I am going to set off into the mountains! May you be my helper! I am going to set off into the Mountains of Cedar-felling! May you be my helper!"















-. From heaven Utu replied to him: "Young man, you are noble already in your own right -- but what would you want with the mountains?"















-. "Utu, I have something to say to you -- a word in your ear! I greet you -- please pay attention! In my city people are dying, and hearts are full of distress. People are lost -- that fills me with {( ms. adds:) wretched} dismay. I craned my neck over the city wall: corpses in the water make the river almost overflow. That is what I see. That will happen to me too -- that is the way things go. No one is tall enough to reach heaven; no one can reach wide enough to stretch over the mountains. Since a man cannot pass beyond the final end of life, I want to set off into the mountains, to establish my renown there. Where renown can be established there, I will establish my renown; and where no renown can be established there, I shall establish the renown of the gods."















-. Utu accepted his tears as a fitting gift. As befits a compassionate person, he turned to him full of compassion: "Now there are seven warriors, sons of a single mother. The first, their eldest brother, has lion's paws and eagle's talons. The second is a …… snake, ……. The third is a dragon snake, ……. The fourth blazes with fire ……. The fifth is a …… snake, ……. The sixth {( ms. adds:) , a shackle that …… the rebel lands in the hills,} beats at the flanks of the mountains {like a battering flood} {( ms. has instead:) , floodwater that destroys all}. The seventh …… flashes like lightning, and no one can deflect {it} {( ms. has instead:) its power}. {( ms. adds  lines:)







 lines fragmentary} {(another ms. adds instead  lines:)







 lines fragmentary …… kingship ……. Nisaba has bestowed …… on you in addition. They ……, and know the routes on earth. They will help you find the …… of the way.} They should guide you to the place in the mountains where the boats have to be pulled from the water! {The warrior, youthful Utu, gave these seven to Gilgameš.} {( mss. have instead the line, placed after line :) These seven the warrior, youthful Utu, gave to Lord Gilgameš.} The feller of cedars was filled with joy; Lord Gilgameš was filled with joy."















-. In his city he had the horn sounded for single men; similarly for two together he made them call out. "Let him who has a household go to his household! Let him who has a mother go to his mother! Let bachelor males, types like me, {( mss. add:) -- fifty of them --} join me at my side!"















-. Whoever had a household went to his household. Whoever had a mother went to his mother. Bachelor males, types like him -- there were fifty -- joined him at his side. He made his way to the blacksmith's, and had them cast …… weapons and axes, the strength of warriors. Then he made his way to the deeply shaded plantations, where he had ebony trees felled, and ?alub trees, apricot trees, and box trees. He …… to his fellow-citizens who were going with him. {( ms. adds:) Warriors, sons of a single mother …….} The first, their eldest brother, has lion's paws and eagle's claws. They will guide him to the place in the mountains where the boats have to be pulled from the water.















. He crossed the first mountain range, {but his intuition did not lead him to find the cedars there} {( ms. has instead:) the cedars did not catch his attention}. {(the same ms. adds:) He crossed the second mountain range, but the cedars did not catch his attention. He crossed the third mountain range, but the cedars did not catch his attention. He crossed the fourth mountain range, but the cedars did not catch his attention. He crossed the fifth mountain range, but the cedars did not catch his attention. He crossed the sixth mountain range, but the cedars did not catch his attention.} {(another ms. adds instead:)

He crossed the third mountain range, but his intuition did not lead him to find the cedars there. He crossed the fourth mountain range, but his intuition did not lead him to find the cedars there. He crossed the fifth mountain range, but his intuition did not lead him to find the cedars there. He crossed the sixth mountain range, but his intuition did not lead him to find the cedars there.}















-. When he had crossed the seventh mountain range, there his intuition led him to find the cedars. He did not need to ask, nor did he have to search any further. Lord Gilgameš began to chop at the cedars, {{while Enkidu lopped off their branches, …… to Gilgameš.} {( ms. has instead:) while Enkidu …… their branches, and his fellow-citizens …….} {( ms. adds:) to ……, Enkidu …….} …… stacked them in piles. {( ms. adds:) ?uwawa …….} He loosed his terrrors against …….} {(instead of lines -,  ms. has:) while Enkidu cut up the timbers, and the widows' sons who had come with him heaped them up in piles. Since, because of the ……, ?uwawa had been scared in his lair by Gilgameš, he began to radiate his terrors …….}















-. Gilgameš …… was overcome by sleep, and it affected Enkidu …… as a powerful longing. His fellow-citizens who had come with him flailed around at his feet like puppies. Enkidu awoke from his dream, shuddering from his sleep. He rubbed his eyes; there was eery silence everywhere. He touched Gilgameš, but could not rouse him. He spoke to him, but he did not reply.















-. "You who have gone to sleep, you who have gone to sleep! Gilgameš, young lord of Kulaba, how long will you sleep for? The mountains are becoming indistinct as the shadows fall across them; the evening twilight lies over them. Proud Utu has already gone to the bosom of his mother Ningal. Gilgameš, how long will you sleep for? The sons of your city who came with you should not have to wait at the foot of the hills. Their own mothers should not have to twine string in the square of your city."















-. He thrust that into his right ear; he covered him with his aggressive words as if with a cloth {( ms. adds:) , laid them out like linen}. He {gathered} {( mss. have instead:) picked up} in his hand a cloth with thirty shekels of oil on it and {smothered} {( ms. has instead:) rubbed} it over Gilgameš's chest. Then Gilgameš stood up like a bull on the great earth. Bending his neck downwards, he yelled at him:















-. "By the life of my own mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda! Am I to become again as if I were slumbering still on the lap of my own mother Ninsumun?"















-. A second time he spoke to him: "By the life of my own mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda! Until I discover whether that person was a human or a god, I shall not direct back to the city my steps which I have directed to the mountains."















-. The slave, trying to ameliorate the situation, trying to make life appear more attractive, answered his master:















-. "My master, you have not yet really seen that person, he should not vex you. -- But he vexes me -- me, who have seen him before. His pugnacious mouth is a dragon's maw; his face is a lion's grimace. His chest is like a raging flood; no one {dare approach} {( ms. has instead:) can escape from} his brow, which devours the reedbeds. {( mss. adds  line:) A man-eating lion, he never wipes away the blood from his slaver.} {( ms. adds instead  lines:)







 line fragmentary …… a lion eating a corpse, he never wipes away the blood







 lines fragmentary} Travel on, my master, up into the mountains! -- but I shall travel back to the city. If I say to your mother about you "He is alive!", she will laugh. But afterwards I shall say to her about you "He is dead!", and she will certainly weep {over you} {( ms. has instead:) bitterly}." {( ms. adds:) …… replied to ……:}















-. "Look, Enkidu, two people together will not perish! A grappling-pole does not sink! No one can cut through a three-ply cloth! Water cannot wash someone away from a wall! Fire in a reed house cannot be extinguished! You help me, and I will help you -- what can anyone do against us then? When it sank, when it sank, when the Magan boat sank, when the magilum barge sank, then at least the life-saving grappling-pole of the boat {was rescued} {( ms. has instead:) was not allowed to sink}! Come on, let's get after him and get a sight of him!"















-. "If we go after him, there will be terror! There will be terror. Turn back! There will be blood! There wil be blood! Turn back!"















. "Whatever you may think -- come on, let's get after him!"















-. Before a man can approach within even sixty times six yards, ?uwawa has already reached his house among the cedars. When he looks at someone, it is the look of death. When he shakes his head at someone, it is a gesture full of reproach. {( ms. adds:) When he speaks to someone, he should not prolong his words:} "You may still be a young man, but you will never again return to the city of your mother who bore you!"















-. Fear and terror spread through {his} {( ms. has instead:) Gilgameš's} sinews and his feet. He could not move (?) his feet on the ground; the big toenails of his feet stuck …… to the path (?). At his side …….















-. (?uwawa addressed Gilgameš:) "So come on now, you heroic bearer of a sceptre of wide-ranging power! Noble glory of the gods, angry bull standing ready for a fight! Your mother knew well how to bear sons, and your nurse knew well how to nourish children on the breast! Don't be afraid, rest your hand on the ground!"















-. Gilgameš rested his hand on the ground, and addressed ?uwawa: "By the life of my own mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda! No one really knows where in the mountains you live; they would like to know where in the mountains you live. Here, I have brought you En-me-barage-si, my big sister, to be your wife in the mountains."















-. And again he addressed him: "By the life of my mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda! No one really knows where in the mountains you live; they would like to know where in the mountains you live. Here, I have brought you Ma-tur, my little sister, to be your concubine in the mountains. Just hand over your terrors to me! I want to become your kinsman!"















-. Then ?uwawa handed over to him his first terror. Gilgameš's fellow-citizens who had come with him began to lop off the branches and bundle them together, so as to lay them down at the foot of the hills.















A-K. {(Several mss. preserve a more elaborate, but repetitive, narrative built on the pattern of lines -. Some preserve the repetitions in an extremely abbreviated form. No ms. known to be from Nibru preserves the additional lines. One ms. of unknown origin adds at least  lines (and another fragmentary ms. of unknown origin gives an abbreviated version of these, always replacing 'terror' by 'aura'):) And again he addressed him: "By the life of my mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda! No one really knows where in the mountains you live; they would like to know where in the mountains you live. Here, I have brought to the mountains for you ……. Couldn't I get close to you and your family? Just hand over your terrors to me! I want to become your kinsman!" Then ?uwawa handed over to him his second terror. Gilgameš's fellow-citizens who had come with him began to lop off the branches and bundle them together, so as to lay them down at the foot of the hills.}















L-V. {And a third time he addressed him: "By the life of my mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda!

Here, I have brought to the mountains for you some eša flour -- the food of the gods! -- and a waterskin of cool water. Couldn't I get close to you and your family? Just hand over your terrors to me! I want to become your kinsman!" Then ?uwawa handed over to him his third terror.

Couldn't I get close to you and your family? Just hand over your terrors to me! I want to become your kinsman!" Then ?uwawa handed over to him his fourth terror. Gilgameš's fellow-citizens who had come with him began to lop off the branches and bundle them together, so as to lay them down at the foot of the hills.}















GG-PP. {And a fifth time he addressed him: "By the life of my mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda! No one really knows where in the mountains you live; they would like to know where in the mountains you live. Here, I have brought to the mountains for you some tiny shoes for your tiny feet. Couldn't I get close to you and your family? Just hand over your terrors to me! I want to become your kinsman!" Then ?uwawa handed over to him his fifth terror. Gilgameš's fellow-citizens who had come with him began to lop off the branches and bundle them together, so as to lay them down at the foot of the hills.}















QQ-AAA. {And a sixth time he addressed him: "By the life of my mother Ninsumun and of my father, holy Lugalbanda! No one really knows where in the mountains you live; they would like to know where in the mountains you live. Here, I have brought you rock-crystal, nir stone and lapis lazuli -- from the mountains. Couldn't I get close to you and your family? Just hand over your terrors to me! I want to become your kinsman!" Then ?uwawa handed over to him his sixth terror. Gilgameš's fellow-citizens who had come with him began to lop off the branches and bundle them together, so as to lay them down at the foot of the hills.}















-. When ?uwawa had finally handed over to him his seventh terror, Gilgameš found himself beside ?uwawa. He {went up to him gradually} {( ms. has instead:) ……} from behind, as one does with a …… snake. He made as if to kiss him, but then punched him on the cheek with his fist.















. ?uwawa bared his teeth at him {( ms. adds:) , furrowing his brows at him}. {( mss. from Urim add  lines:) ?uwawa addressed Gilgameš: "Hero, …… to act falsely!" The two of them …… on him ……. …… the warrior from his dwelling. …… said to him, "Sit down!" …… ?uwawa from his dwelling. …… said to him, "Sit down!"

He tied up his arms like a captured man. {( of the mss. adds  further line:) ?uwawa wept, …….}}

I was born in the mountains -- you brought me up! Yet Gilgameš swore to me by heaven, by earth, and by the mountains."















-. ?uwawa clutched at Gilgameš's hand, and prostrated himself before him. Then Gilgameš's noble heart took pity on him. {Gilgameš addressed Enkidu} {( mss. have instead:) He addressed his slave Enkidu}:















-. "Enkidu, let the captured bird run away home! Let the captured man return to his mother's embrace!"















-. {Enkidu replied to Gilgameš} {( mss. have instead:) His slave Enkidu replied}: "Come on now, you heroic bearer of a sceptre of wide-ranging power!

-. "In Unug people are dying, and souls are full of distress. People are lost -- that fills me with dismay. I lean out over the city wall: bodies in the water make the river almost overflow. That is what I see: that people die thus, which fills me with despair; that the end of life is unavoidable; that the grave, the all-powerful underworld, will spare no one; that no one is tall enough to block off the underworld; that no one is broad enough to cover over the underworld -- the boundary that a man cannot cross at the final end of life.

A decision that concerns the Mountains of Cedar-felling is the business of youthful Utu."















-. Utu of heaven put on his lapis-lazuli diadem and came forward with head high. In his hand Gilgameš, the lord of Kulaba, held a holy staff before his nose: "Utu, I want to set off into the mountains! May you be my helper! I want to set off into the mountains of Cedar-felling! May you be my helper!"

Warriors, whether experienced or inexperienced, who have no wife, who have no children -- let such people join me at my side as the companions of Gilgameš."















-. The king left the city. Gilgameš left Kulaba, to follow the route to the Mountains of Cedar-felling. He crossed the first mountain range, but his intuition did not lead him to find the cedars there. He crossed the second mountain range, but his intuition did not lead him to find the cedars there.
