		They were gazing at the Cedar Mountain,
			dwelling of gods, throne-dais of goddesses:
		 face of the land the cedar was proffering its abundance,
			sweet was its shade, full of delight.
		 tangled was the thorny undergrowth, the forest a thick canopy,
			cedars  ballukku-trees were  it had no ways in.
		For one league on all sides cedars  saplings,
			cypresses  for two-thirds of a league.
		The cedar was scabbed with lumps   sixty  height,

		 were singing a song, making the . . . pipe loud.
			A wood pigeon was moaning, a turtle dove calling in answer.

			daily they bash out a rhythm in the presence of Ḫumbaba.
		As the cedar  its shadow,

			saying to Enkidu:
		“ my friend, are we trembling like weaklings,
			 who came across all the mountains?
		 . . . before us?
			 shall we see the light?”

Enkidu replies:
			“My  is one who is experienced in combat,
		one who has been in battle has no fear of death.
			You have been smeared in  so you need not fear death.
		 wrathful, and like a very dervish go into a frenzy,
			let  boom loud  a kettledrum.
		Let stiffness leave your arms and feebleness arise  your legs!”
Gilgameš:
			“Take hold of me, my friend, as one we shall
