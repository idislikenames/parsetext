=======from back to the cedar forest=======
Translation, using all extant manuscripts
	1	They stood there marvelling at(?)the forest,
	2		observing the height of the cedars,
	3		observing the way into the forest.
	4	Where Ḫumbaba came and went there was a track,
	5		the paths were in good order and the way was well trodden.
	6	They were gazing at the Cedar Mountain,
	7		dwelling of gods, throne-dais of goddesses:
	8	[on the] face of the land the cedar was proffering its abundance,
	9		sweet was its shade, full of delight.
	10	[All] tangled was the thorny undergrowth, the forest a thick canopy,
	11		cedars (and) ballukku-trees were [so entangled,] it had no ways in.
	12	For one league on all sides cedars [sent forth] saplings,
	13		cypresses [. . .] for two-thirds of a league.
	14	The cedar was scabbed with lumps (of resin) [for] sixty (cubits’) height,
	15		resin [oozed] forth, drizzling down like rain,
	16	[flowing freely(?)] for ravines to bear away.
	17		[Through] all the forest a bird began to sing:
	18	[. . .] were answering one another, a constant din was the noise,
	19		[A solitary(?)] tree-cricket set off a noisy chorus,
	20	[. . .] were singing a song, making the . . . pipe loud.
	21		A wood pigeon was moaning, a turtle dove calling in answer.
	22	[At the call of] the stork, the forest exults,
	23		[at the cry of] the francolin, the forest exults in plenty.
	24	[Monkey mothers] sing aloud, a youngster monkey shrieks:
	25		[like a band(?)] of musicians and harpists,
	26		daily they bash out a rhythm in the presence of Ḫumbaba.
	27	As the cedar [cast] its shadow,
	28		[terror] fell on Gilgameš.
	29	[Stiffness took] a grip of his arms,
	30		and feebleness beset his legs.
	31	[Enkidu] opened his mouth to speak,
			saying to Gilgameš:
	32	“[Let us go] into the midst of the forest,
	33		[set] to it and let us raise (our battle) cry.”
	34	[Gilgameš] opened his mouth to speak,
			saying to Enkidu:
	35	“[Why,] my friend, are we trembling like weaklings,
	36		[we] who came across all the mountains?
	37	[Shall . . .] . . . before us?
	38		[. . .] shall we see the light?”

Enkidu replies:
	39		“My [friend] is one who is experienced in combat,
	40	one who has been in battle has no fear of death.
	41		You have been smeared in [blood,] so you need not fear death.
	42	[Wax] wrathful, and like a very dervish go into a frenzy,
	43		let [your shout] boom loud [like] a kettledrum.
	44	Let stiffness leave your arms and feebleness arise [from] your legs!”
Gilgameš:
	45		“Take hold of me, my friend, as one we shall [. . .]
	46	[Let] your mind dwell on combat!”

	61	Ḫumbaba [talked with himself, speaking a word:]
	62		“Did not a . . . go [. . . . . . ?]
	63	Did not [. . . . . . . . . ?]
	64		Why are [. . .] perturbed [and . . . ?]
	65	Why are my own [. . . . . . ?]
	66		In terror(?) for . . . [. . . . . .]
	67	How indeed . . . [. . . . . . ?]
	68		In my very bed [. . . . . .]
	69	For sure Enkidu(?) [. . . . . .]
	70		In goodwill he [. . . . . .]
	71	If a word to [. . . . . .]
	72		May Enlil curse [him . . . . . . !]”
	73	Enkidu opened his mouth [to speak,]
			[saying to Gilgameš:]
	74	“My friend, Ḫumbaba [. . . . . . ,]
	75		One friend is one alone, but [two are two!]
	76	Though they be weak, two [. . . . . . ,]
	77		[though one alone cannot climb] a glacis slope, two [. . .]
	78	Two triplets [. . . . . . . . . .]
	79		a three-ply rope [is not easily broken.]
	80	As for a strong dog, [its] two pups [will overcome it(?).]
	81		Fix firm your stance [. . . . . .]
	82	My friend, an arrow’s dart [. . . . . .]
	83		The journey that you are [making . . . . . .]
	84	When we have departed [. . . . . .]
	85		. . . is borne [. . . . . .]
	86	Its . . . two [. . . . . .]
	87		My friend, on the winds(?) that Šamaš [. . .]
	88	His rear is a tempest, [his front is wind.]
	89		Speak to Šamaš, that he may [give you his thirteen winds(?)!]”
	90	Gilgameš lifted up his head, [weeping before Šamaš,]
	91		[his tears] flowing before the rays of the sun.
	92	“[Do not forget] that day, O Šamaš, that I placed my trust in you!
	93		Now come to my aid and [. . . . . .]
	94	Upon Gilgameš, scion from Uruk’s midst, [place your protection!]”
	95		Šamaš heard what [he] had spoken,
	96	straight away a voice [cried to him from the heavens:]
	97	“Fear not, stand against him! He must not [enter his dwelling,]
	98		he must not go into the grove, he must not [. . . ,]
	99	before he has wrapped himself in his seven cloaks [of radiance!]
	100		One he is wrapped in, six he has divested.”
	101	They [. . . . . . . . . . . . ,]
	102		like a fierce wild bull, ready to charge [. . .]
	103	He bellowed once, and it was (a bellow) full of terror,

249		Enkidu [opened his mouth to speak, saying to Gilgameš:]
	250	“My friend, [catch a bird,]
	251		and where [can its hatchlings go?]
	252	Ḫumbaba [. . . . . . . . .]
	253		whither will [they go . . . . . . ?]
	254	Whither will [they go . . . . . . ?]”
	255		[Ḫumbaba] heard [what Enkidu said,]
	256	Ḫumbaba lifted up his head, [weeping before Šamaš,]
	257		[his tears flowing] before the rays of the sun:
	258	“You did enter, O Enkidu, [. . . . . .]
	259		in the clashing of weapons a prince [. . .]
	260	But for his palace retainer hostilities [are . . .]
	261		you sit before [him] like (a sheep before) a shepherd,
	262		and like one at his beck and call you [. . .]
	263	Now, Enkidu, [my release] rests with you, and [. . . ,]
	264		speak to Gilgameš so he [spares] my life!”
	265	Enkidu opened his mouth to speak,
			saying [to Gilgameš:]
	266	“My friend, Ḫumbaba, guardian of the Forest [of Cedar,]
	267		finish him, slay him, do [away with his power!]
	268	Ḫumbaba, the forest guardian: finish [him, slay him, do away with his power,
	269		before [Enlil] the foremost learns (about it),
	270	and the great gods become angry with us:
	271		Enlil in Nippur, Šamaš in [Larsa . . .]
		Establish an eternal [. . . ,]

272    how Gilgameš slew [the fearsome(?)] Ḫumbaba!”
	273	Ḫumbaba heard . . . [. . .] and . . . [. . .]
	274	Ḫumbaba lifted [up his head, weeping before Šamaš,]

	302	[Enkidu] opened his mouth to speak,

	303	“[My friend,] we have reduced the forest [to] a wasteland,
	304		[how] shall we answer Enlil in Nippur?
	305	‘[In] your might you slew the guardian,

	311	Gilgameš was cutting down the tree,

	He washed his matted hair, he cleaned [his equipment.]

	1	[He who saw the Deep, the] foundation of the country,
	2		[who knew…,] was wise in everything!
	3	[Gilgameš, who] saw the Deep, the foundation of the country,
	4		[who] knew […,] was wise in everything!
	5	[He explored] everywhere the seats [of power,]
	6		he [learnt] the totality of wisdom about everything.
	7	He saw the secret and uncovered the hidden,
	8		he brought back a message from the antediluvian age.
	9	He came a distant road and was weary but granted rest,
	10		[he] set down on a stele all (his) labours.
	11	He built the wall of Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
	12		of holy Eanna, the pure storehouse.
	13	See its wall which is like a strand of wool,
	14		view its parapet which nobody can replicate!
	15	Take the stairway that has been there since ancient times,
	16		and draw near to Eanna, the seat of Ištar,
	17		that no later king can replicate, nor any man.
	18	Go up on to the wall of Uruk and walk around,
	19		survey the foundation platform, inspect the brickwork!
	20	(See) if its brickwork is not kiln-fired brick,
	21		and if the Seven Sages did not lay its foundations!
	22	[One šār is] city, [one šār] date-grove, one šār is clay-pit, half a šār the temple of Ištar:
	23		[three šār] and a half, Uruk, (its) measurement.
	24	[Find] the tablet-box of cedar,
	25		[release] its clasps of bronze!
	26	[Open] the lid of its secret,
	27		[lift] up the tablet of lapis lazuli and read out
	28		all the misfortunes, all that Gilgameš went through!
	29	Surpassing all (other) kings, hero endowed with a superb physique,
	30		brave native of Uruk, butting wild bull!
	31	Going at the fore he was the leader,
	32		going also at the rear, the trust of his brothers!
	33	A mighty bank, the protection of his troops,
	34		a violent flood-wave that smashes a stone wall!
	35	Wild bull of Lugalbanda, Gilgameš, perfect of strength,
	36		suckling of the exalted cow, Wild-Cow Ninsun!
	37	Gilgameš so tall, perfect and terrible,
	38		who opened passes in the mountains;
	39	who dug wells on the hill-flanks,
	40		and crossed the ocean, the wide sea, as far as the sunrise;
	41	who scoured the world-regions ever searching for life,
	42		and reached by his strength ‡ta-napišti the Far-Away;
	43	who restored the cult-centres that the Deluge destroyed,
	44		and established the proper rites for the human race!
	45	Who is there that can be compared with him in kingly status,
	46		and can say like Gilgameš, ‘It is I am the king’?
	47	Gilgameš was his name from the day he was born,
	48		two-thirds of him god but a third of him human.
	49	Bēlet-ilī drew the shape of his body,
	50		Nudimmud brought his form to perfection.

	52		[ . . . ] stature . . . [ . . . ]
	53	[ . . . ] the distance between [ . . . ,]
		A short lacuna occurs at this point
	56		A triple cubit was his foot, half a rod his leg.
	57	Six cubits was [his] stride,
	58		[x] cubits the . . . of his [ . . . ]
	59	His cheeks were bearded like those of [ . . . ,]
	60		the locks of his hair growing [thickly as Nissaba’s.]
	61	[As] he grew up he was perfect in [his] beauty,
	62		by human standards [he was] very handsome.
	63	He goes [about] in the sheepfold of Uruk,
	64		lording it like a wild bull, [head] held high.
	65	He has not any equal, [his] weapons being ready,
	66		[his] companions are kept on their feet by the ball.
	67	The young men of Uruk are wrongfully vexed,

68	Gilgameš lets no son go free to [his] father.
	69	Day and night he behaves with fierce arrogance,
	70		[King] Gilgameš, [who guides the numerous people,]
	71	he who is shepherd of Uruk-the-Sheepfold!
	72 		[Gilgameš] lets no [daughter go free to her] mother,

	75	‘[Powerful, pre-eminent,] expert, [ . . . ,]
	76		[Gilgameš] lets [no] girl go free to [her bride-groom.]’
	77	The warrior’s daughter, the [young man’s bride,]
	78		the goddesses were listening to their complaint.
	79	The gods of heaven, lords of initiative,
	80		[to Anu . . . . . . ] . . . . . . :
	81		‘Have you bred, indeed, a savage wild bull in Uruk-the-Sheepfold?
	82	He has not any equal, his weapons being ready,
	83		his companions are kept on their feet by the ball.
	84	He has wrongfully vexed [the young men of Uruk,]
	85		Gilgameš lets no son go free to his father.
	86	Day and [night he behaves] with fierce [arrogance,]
	87		he who is shepherd of Uruk-the-Sheepfold!
	88	[King] Gilgameš, [who guides the] numerous [people,]
	89		he is their shepherd and their [ . . . ] . . . !
	90	Powerful, pre-eminent, expert, [ . . . ,]
	91		Gilgameš lets no girl go free to [her] bride-[groom.]’
	92	The warrior’s daughter, the young [man’s] bride,
	93		[Anu] was listening to their complaint.
	94	They summoned Aruru, the great one:
	95		‘You, O Aruru, created [man:]
	96		now create what he suggests!
	97	Let him be equal to the storm of his heart,
	98		let them rival each other and so let Uruk be rested.”
	99	When Aruru heard this,
	100		she fashioned Anu’s idea in her heart.
	101	Aruru washed her hands,
	102		she took a pinch of clay, she threw it down in the wild.
	103	In the wild she created Enkidu, the hero,
	104		an offspring of silence, knit strong by Ninurta.

105	All his body is matted with hair,
106		he is adorned with tresses like a woman:
107	the locks of his hair grow as thickly as Nissaba’s,
108		he knows not at all a people nor even a country.
109	He was clad in a garment like Šakkan’s,
110		feeding on grass with the very gazelles.
111	Jostling at the water-hole with the herd,
112		he enjoyed the water with the animals.
113	A hunter, a trapper-man,
114		came face to face with him by the water-hole.
115	One day, a second and a third, he came face to face with him by the water-hole.
116	The hunter saw him and his expression froze,
117		[he] and his herds — he went back to his lair.
118	[He was] troubled, he grew still, he grew silent,
119		his mood [was unhappy,] his face clouded over.
120	There [was] sorrow in his heart,
121		his face was like [one who has travelled] distant [roads.]

122	The hunter opened [his mouth] to speak, saying [to his father:]
123		‘My father, [there was a] certain fellow who came [by the water-hole.]
124	Mightiest in the [land, he possesses] strength,
125		[his strength] is as mighty [as a lump of rock] from the sky.
126	[He wanders] over the hills [all day,]
127		[constantly] with the herd [he feeds on grass.]
128	[Constantly] his feet [are found] by the water-hole,
129		[I am afraid and so] I do not go up to him.
130	[He has filled in the] pits that I dug,
131		[he has uprooted] my snares that I laid.
132	[He has set free from my grasp] the herd, the animals of the wild,
133		[he will not let] me do the work of the wild.’

134	[His father opened his mouth to speak,] saying to the hunter:
135		[‘My son,  . . . . . . ] Uruk, Gilgameš.
136	[ . . . . . . . . . ] into his presence,
137		his strength is as mighty [as a lump of rock from the sky.19]
138	[Take the road, set] your face [toward Uruk,]
139		[ . . . . . . . . . ] the strength of a man!
140	[Go, my son,] bring [with you Šamhat the harlot,]
141		[ . . . . . . . . . ] like a mighty man!
142	[When the herd comes] down [to] the water-hole,
143		[she should strip off] her [clothing to reveal] her charms.
144	[He will see] her and will go up [to] her,
145		his herd will be estranged from him, [though he grew up] in its presence.’
146	To the advice of his father [ . . . ] . . .
147		the hunter went off [ . . . . . . ]
148	He took the road, he [set his face] toward Uruk,
149		[to] the king, Gilgameš, [ . . . . . . ]
150	‘There was a certain fellow who [came by the water-hole,]
151		mightiest in the land, [he possesses strength,]
152		[his strength is] as mighty as a lump of rock from the sky.
153	He wanders over the hills [all day,]
154		constantly with the herd [he feeds on grass.]
155	Constantly his feet [are found] by the water-[hole,]
156		I am afraid and so I do not go up to [him.]
157	He has filled in the pits that I dug,
158		he has uprooted my snares [that I laid.]
159	He has released from my grasp the herds, the animals [of the] wild,
160		he will not let me do the work [of the] wild.’
161	Gilgameš said to him, to the hunter:
162		‘Go, O hunter, take with you Šamḫat the harlot.
163	When the herd comes down to the water-hole,
164		she should strip off her clothing to reveal her charms.
165	He will see her and will go up to her,
166		his herd will be estranged from him, though he grew up in its presence.’
167	Off went the hunter, he took with him Šamḫat the harlot,
168		they set out on the road, they started the journey.
169	On the third day they arrived at the destination;
170		the hunter and the harlot sat down to wait.
171	One day, a second day, they sat by the water-hole,
172		(then) the herd arrived to drink at the water-hole.
173	The animals arrived, they enjoyed the water,
174		and also Enkidu himself, whose birth-place was the hills.
175	Feeding on grass with the very gazelles,
176		jostling at the water-hole with the herd,

177		he enjoyed the water with the animals.
178	(Then) Šamḫat saw him, the man-savage,
179		a murderous fellow from the midst of the wild.
180	‘This is he, Šamḫat! Uncradle your bosom;
181		bare your sex so he may take in your charms!
182	Do not show fear, take in his scent!
183		He will see you and he will come up to you.
184	Spread your clothing so he may lie on you,
185		treat the man to the work of a woman!
186	His ‘love’ will caress and embrace you,
187		his herd will be estranged from him, though he grew up in its presence.’
188	Šamḫat let loose her skirts,
189 		she bared her sex and he took in her charms.
190	She showed no fear, she took in his scent:
191		she spread her clothing and he lay upon her.
192	She treated the man to the work of a woman,
193		his ‘love’ caressed and embraced her.
194	For six days and seven nights Enkidu, erect, did couple with Šamḫat.
195	After he was sated with her delights,
196		he turned his face toward his herd.
197	The gazelles saw Enkidu and they started running,
198		the animals of the wild moved away from his person.
199	Enkidu had defiled his body so pure,
200		his legs stood still, though his herd was on the move.
201	Enkidu was diminished, his running was not as before,
202		but he had reason, he [was] wide of understanding.
203	He came back and sat down at the feet of the harlot,
204		watching the harlot, (observing) her features.
205	Then his ears heard what the [harlot] was speaking,
206		[as the harlot] said to him, to Enkidu:
207	‘You are handsome, Enkidu, you are just like a god,

208		why do you roam the wild with the animals?
209	Come, I will lead you to Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
210		to the sacred temple, the dwelling of Anu and Ištar!
211	where Gilgameš is perfect in strength,
212		and lords it over the menfolk like a wild bull.’
213	She talked to him and what she said found favour,
214		his heart (now) wise was seeking a friend.
215	Enkidu said to her, to the harlot:
216	‘Come, Šamḫat, take me along
217		to the sacred temple, the holy dwelling of Anu and Ištar,
218	where Gilgameš is perfect in strength,
219		and lords it over the menfolk like a wild bull!
220	I, myself, will challenge him, mighty . . . ,
221		[I will vaunt] myself in Uruk, (saying) “I am the mightiest!”
222	[ . . . ] . . . I shall change the order of things,
223		[the one] born in the wild is mighty, he has strength.’
224	‘Let [the people] see your face,
225		[ . . . . . . that] exists I know indeed.
226	Go, Enkidu, to Uruk-the-Sheepfold,
227		where the young men are girt with waistbands.
228	Every day [ . . . ] a festival is held,
229		where the drums are repeatedly beaten,
230	and the harlots are comely of figure,
231		graced with charm, full of joy.
232	The nobles are driven from their beds at night!
233		O Enkidu, [who do not (yet)] know life—
234	I will show you Gilgameš, the man so merry,
235		look at him, regard his face!
236	He is fair in manhood, he has dignified bearing,
237		his whole person is graced with charm.
238	He has a strength more mighty than you,
239		he is unsleeping by day and by night.
240	O Enkidu, get rid of your sinful intention,
241		as for Gilgameš Šamaš loves him.
242	Anu, Enlil and Ea broadened his wisdom:
243		even before you came from the uplands,
244	Gilgameš in Uruk was having dreams about you: —
245	Gilgameš arose to reveal a dream, saying to his mother:
246		“O mother, the dream that I saw in the course of this night —
247	the stars of the heavens appeared before me,
248		like lumps of rock from the sky they kept falling towards me.
249	I picked one up but it was too much for me,
250		I kept trying to roll it but I could not dislodge it.
251	The land of Uruk was standing around [it,]
252		[the land was gathered] about it.
253	A crowd [was jostling] before [it,]
254		[the menfolk were] thronging around it.
255	They were kissing its feet [like a little] baby’s;
256		[I loved it] like a wife and I caressed and embraced it.
257	[I picked it up and] set it down at [your] feet,
258		[and you, you] made it my equal.”
259	[The mother of Gilgameš] was clever, she was wise,
		she knew everything, she said to her son;
260	[Wild-Cow] Ninsun was clever, she was wise,
		she knew everything, she said to Gilgameš:
261	“The stars of heaven [appeared] before you,
262		[like a] lump of rock from the sky44 one fell toward you.
263	You picked it up but it was too much for you,
264		you kept trying to roll it but you could not dislodge it.
265	You picked it up and set it down at my feet,
266		and I, I made it your equal,
267	you loved it like a wife, caressing and embracing it.
268		A mighty companion will come to you, the saviour of (his) friend:
269	he is the mightiest in the land, he has strength,
270		his strength is as mighty as a lump of rock from the sky.44
271	You will love him like a wife, caressing and embracing him,
272		he, being mighty, [will] often save you.
273	[Favourable and precious] was your dream!”
	273a	He saw a second dream,
274		he arose and entered before the goddess, his mother.
275	Gilgameš said to her, to his mother,
276		“And again, O mother, I have seen a second dream.
277	[In a street] of Uruk-Main-Street,
278		an axe was lying and people were gathered around it.
279	The land [of Uruk] was standing around it,
280		[the land was] gathered about it.
281	[A crowd] was jostling before it,
282		[the menfolk were] thronging around it.
283	I picked it up and set it down at your feet,
284		[I loved] it like a wife and I caressed and embraced it,
285		[and you,] you made it my equal.”
286	The mother of Gilgameš was clever, she was wise,
		she knew everything, she said to her son;
287	Wild-Cow Ninsun was clever, she was wise,
		she knew everything, she said to Gilgameš:
288	“My son, the axe you saw is a man,
289		you will love him like a wife, and will caress and embrace him,
290	and I, I shall make him your equal.
291		A mighty companion will come to you, the saviour of (his) friend:
292	he is the mightiest in the land, he has strength,
293		his strength is as mighty as a lump of rock from the sky.”
294	Gilgameš said to her, to his mother,
295		“O mother, by Counsellor Enlil’s command may it befall me!
296	I will acquire a friend, a counsellor,
297		a friend, a counsellor, I will acquire!”
298	[(Thus) he has] seen his dreams.’
299	[After] Šamḫat told Enkidu the dreams of Gilgameš,
300		the two of [them were making] love together.
